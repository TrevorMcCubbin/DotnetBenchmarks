## Getting Started

To get started with .NET benchmarks, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TrevorMcCubbin/DotnetBenchmarks.git
cd DotnetBenchmarks
```

Install .NET 8 SDK:
Make sure you have the .NET Core SDK installed.

Run Benchmarks:
Execute the following command to run the benchmarks:

```bash
dotnet run -c release --project .\src\DotnetBenchmarks.Json\DotnetBenchmarks.Json.csproj
```

Explore Results:
After running the benchmarks, explore the generated reports and analyze the performance metrics.

## Benchmarking Guidelines

When contributing benchmarks or analyzing results, please follow these guidelines:

    Isolate Benchmarks:
    Ensure that each benchmark is isolated and representative of a specific scenario or functionality.

    Repeatable Results:
    Benchmarks should be repeatable, providing consistent results across multiple runs.

    Documentation:
    Clearly document the purpose and methodology of each benchmark. Include relevant details about the test environment.

    Avoid Premature Optimization:
    Focus on meaningful optimizations rather than premature optimizations. Consider the trade-offs between readability and performance.

    Report Issues:
    If you encounter any issues or unexpected behavior in benchmarks, please report them using the GitHub Issues page.
